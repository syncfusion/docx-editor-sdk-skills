## Getting Started

### How to Integrate Skills

**Step 1: Checkout and copy the required skills**

Clone or download the DOCX-Editor-SDK-Skills repository and copy the **syncfusion-vue-docx-editor** skill from the `skills/` directory.

**Step 2: Install the skill**

Place the copied skill folder in your workspace following this structure:

```
your-workspace/
├── .github/skills/ or .claude/skills/ or .codestudio/skills/
│   └── syncfusion-vue-docx-editor/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── references/
├── your-project-files...
└── src/
    └── App.vue
```

**Step 3: Verify and manage your skills**

Type `/skills` in the GitHub Copilot or Code Studio chat to quickly access the Configure Skills menu and manage your installed skills.

**Step 4: Use skills in VS Code**

There are two ways to use skills:

1. **Slash commands** - Type `/` in the GitHub Copilot chat to see available skills. For example:
   ```
   /syncfusion-vue-docx-editor Create a Document Editor with built-in toolbar options
   ```

2. **Automatic loading** - Simply describe your task naturally, and your AI Agent automatically loads the relevant skill:
   ```
   Create a Vue document editor with a built-in toolbar that allows users to open, edit, and save documents
   ```

When a skill is loaded, AI Agent gains specialized knowledge of the Syncfusion Vue DOCX Editor and can help you generate code snippets or build complete document editor features.

## Prerequisites

### Runnable Vue Project

To integrate the Syncfusion DOCX Editor component directly into your project files, you need a working Vue application. If you don't have one yet, follow the [Getting Started guide](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-processor/vue/getting-started) to set up a new Vue project with Vue CLI.

**Alternative Options:**
- **No project needed:** You can request code snippets directly in the chat window for learning or reference purposes
- **Separate file generation:** Code can be saved to the skill's output folder (`syncfusion-vue-docx-editor/output/`) as standalone files
