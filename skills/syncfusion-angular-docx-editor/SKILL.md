# Syncfusion Angular DOCX Editor

## Overview

This skill helps developers generate Angular code for integrating the Syncfusion DOCX Editor into their applications. It provides ready-to-use snippets and best practices for embedding a Document Editor that supports editing, reviewing, formatting, and more.

## Key Capabilities

- **Document Editing:** Create, edit, and view Word documents.
- **Protection:** Apply read-only mode, allow comments, allow form filling, enforce tracked changes,and define editable ranges.
- **Review:** Enable track changes (revisions) and accept/reject changes.
- **Comments:** Add comments, replies, and author metadata.
- **Find and replace:** Perform programmatic find and replace operations for automation.
- **Form Fields:** Insert and fill text fields, check boxes, and dropdown form fields.

## Prerequisites

- npm package: `@syncfusion/ej2-angular-documenteditor`
- Syncfusion License: https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense


## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Create Document Editor 
**User:** "Show me code to create a Document Editor component."
**Result:** A Angular snippet that initializes the Document Editor component

### Example 2: Enable Read‑Only Restriction Mode
**User:** "Create a Document Editor with Read‑Only restriction mode."
**Result:** A Angular snippet that loads a document and applies read-only protection during initialization.

## Getting Started — Minimal Angular Code

Minimal Angular Document Editor setup for a plain web project:


```typescript
import { DocumentEditorContainerModule } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-documenteditor';
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ToolbarService } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-documenteditor';

@Component({
    imports: [        
        DocumentEditorContainerModule
    ],
    standalone: true,
    selector: 'app-root',
    template: `<ejs-documenteditorcontainer 
                   serviceUrl="https://document.syncfusion.com/web-services/docx-editor/api/documenteditor/" 
                   height="600px" 
                   style="display:block" 
                   [enableToolbar]=true>
               </ejs-documenteditorcontainer>`,
    providers: [ToolbarService]
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
    ngOnInit(): void {
    }
}
```

> Note: The `serviceUrl` in examples is for evaluation/demo. Host your own service for production.

## Generate Angular Code for the User's Project

**Trigger keywords:** "code", "snippet", "how to", "show me", "sample", "example code", "generate code", "implement", "add to component", "configure documenteditor", "create" , "angular document editor", "docx editor", "document editor", "track changes", "load docx", "comments", "accept changes", "protect document", "find and replace", "content control"

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze the user's request to identify the feature (e.g., track changes, restrict editing, toolbar customization).
2. Read the relevant `references/*.md` file(s) to understand the APIs and code patterns for the requested feature.
3. **STOP before generating code.** Check if the user has already chosen a delivery mode.
4. **If no delivery mode is chosen yet**, you MUST ask the user first using this concise multiple-choice question:

   **"How would you like to receive the generated code?"**
   
   - **Option 1:** Replace the code in a specific project file (you'll need to provide the file path and confirm)
   - **Option 2:** Share the code directly in the chat window

5. **Only after the user selects a delivery mode**, proceed to generate Angular code using the APIs and snippets from `references/*.md`, substituting concrete placeholders from the user's project.
6. **Do NOT make changes to workspace project files** unless the user explicitly chose Option 1 and provided the file path with permission.
7. Provide complete Angular snippets and concise integration steps after delivering the code.

*Refer to `## Rules` section for operational constraints (output directory, temporary files, allowed libraries, etc.)*


## Code References

All code snippets and examples are in the `references/` folder. Each file contains:
- **Minimal Angular Code** — a working, ready-to-use snippet
- **Placeholders** — values the user must customize
- **Notes** — best practices, additional information to note while using that functionality, constraints

| File                          | Contents                                               |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| document-editor.md            | Document Editor initialization and container setup     |
| editor-only.md                | Editor-only mode with manual module injection          |
| form-fields.md                | Insert, inspect, fill, reset, and export form fields   |
| comments.md                   | Add, reply to, navigate, and delete comments           |
| track-changes.md              | Enable revisions and accept or reject changes          |
| document-protection.md        | Read-only, comments-only, form, and revision protection|
| spell-check.md                | Spell-check setup, suggestions, and custom dictionaries|
| customize-toolbar.md          | Custom toolbar items, button state, and pane control   |
| find-and-replace.md           | Search, replace, and search-results management         |
| paste-formatting.md           | Preserve clipboard formatting with a backend service   |
| ribbon.md                     | initialize the documenteditor with Ribbon UI           |
| customize-ribbon.md           | Customize Ribbon Tabs                                  |

## Key Rules for Code Generation

1. **No inline code in SKILL.md** — Always point to snippets in `references/*.md`. This file is loaded into context for every prompt; inline code wastes tokens.

2. **Snippets must be tested** — All code must compile and run against the current `@syncfusion/ej2-angular-documenteditor` npm package version.

3. **Minimal Code + Placeholders + Notes** — Every reference file must include:
   - **Minimal Code** (complete, working snippet)
   - **Placeholders** (values user must substitute — marked with `{{ }}` or `[PLACEHOLDER]`)
   - **Notes** (best practices, framework-specific adaptations, constraints)

5. **Share code and notes for the requirement** — Never create temporary files or scripts.

6. **License handling** — Never hardcode license keys. Point user to environment variables or config files.

7. **Framework adaptation** — Default to plain JavaScript/TypeScript. When user specifies framework.

8. **No hallucinated APIs** — Use only verified Syncfusion DOCX Editor SDK method names. One wrong method breaks user trust.

9. **Service URL Note** — When serviceUrl contains https://document.syncfusion.com/web-services/docx-editor/api/documenteditor/, keep it in the snippet and add note message: "The serviceUrl property in the Document Editor is intended only for demonstration and evaluation purposes. For production use, host your own web service."

## Rules

- **Only use Syncfusion Document Editor APIs** — never recommend or use alternative Word Editor libraries.
- **No temporary files** — never create temporary scripts, intermediate files, or scaffolding outside the output directory
- **Angular-only code** — all generated code must be valid Angular, never generate vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, or non-Angular patterns
